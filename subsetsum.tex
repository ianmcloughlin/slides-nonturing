  \begin{alertblock}{Problem}
    Given a set of integers $S$, is there a non-empty subset whose elements sum to zero?
  \end{alertblock}

  \begin{exampleblock}{Example}
    Does $\{ 1, 3, 7, -5, -13, 2, 9, -8 \}$ have such a subset?
  \end{exampleblock}

  \begin{alertblock}{Note}
     If somebody suggests a solution, it is very quick to check it.
    Being able to quickly verify a solution is a characteristic of NP problems.

\begin{frame}{SUBSETSUM and NP}
  \begin{description}
    \item[SUBSETSUM] is NP-complete.
    \item[$2^n$] is the number of subsets. Note that $2^n$ is also the number of settings of $n$ Boolean variables.
    \item[The correspondence] can be seen in terms of $0$'s and $1$'s. In SUBSETSUM the elements from the set that are included in a given subset are represented by $1$'s.
    \item[The usual] proof that SUBSETSUM is NP-complete is done by reduction to 3-SAT.
